\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

As deep learning models continue to permeate various fields, the attention towards adversarial attacks and defenses has significantly grown among researchers and practitioners. 
Among numerous certified robustness methods, randomized smoothing has gradually emerged as a mainstream approach.
Randomized smoothing trains models on random Gaussian noise and utilizes a smoothed classifier to obtain a certified radius. Within this radius, robustness is guaranteed.
Many works have elegantly extended and innovatively refined randomized smoothing, culminating in a steady stream of enhanced outcomes.
\cite{Alpher02}


However, existing randomized smoothing methods entail considerable computational expenses.
Typical randomized smoothing algorithms require the infusion of abundant random Gaussian noise into each clean image during training.
In case of multiple datasets, these training efforts must be repeated for each dataset, thus inflating the training expenses considerably.
Moreover,  a model trained under a specific intensity of Gaussian noise can only resist noise of the similar intensity during inference, proving to be ineffective against noise of dissimilar intensities.
Present methods manage different noise levels by training multiple models under different noise intensities, thereby further escalating the training costs.


To mitigate computational costs, a natural approach would be to incorporate transferability into the robust model. 
This approach should facilitate the efficient adaptation of a robust model, pretrained on a relatively extensive dataset, to various downstream datasets.
Thus,  dealing with noisy images on each downstream dataset demands only a minimal amount of transfer costs.
Furthermore, if a model is capable of managing various intensities of noise, we can notably reduce the costs of both pretraining and fine-tuning.
Advancing further, it is critical to reduce the complexity and the training overhead during fine-tuning.
The most favorable situation would be to handle different noises by merely fine-tuning on clean images.


In this paper, we designed a simple yet highly efficient transfer approach for randomized smoothing.
Our robust model is capable of transferring to multiple downstream datasets, handling various noise intensities, and only requires minimal fine-tuning on clean images (with as few as one epoch) .
Specifically, during the pretraining process, we mix clean images with noisy images infused with different levels of noise . 
This process empowers a model to deal with noise of diverse intensities simultaneously.
Next, we conduct fine-tuning using purely clean images on multiple downstream datasets.
The success of the transfer hinges on two pivotal aspects. 
The first is the mixture of clean and various noisy images during the pretraining phase.
The second is the statistical information in the model's normalization layer.


The mixture of clean and various noisy images offers three distinct advantages.
Firstly, the interaction between clean and various noisy images can stimulate each other, functioning as a data augmentation technique.
Secondly, incorporating clean images into the training enables the model to learn strong semantic representations.
The model can achieve high accuracy on clean images in both the upstream and downstream stages, eliminating the need to make a trade-off between robustness and accuracy.
Thirdly, by encompassing a broader data distribution, the model's data distribution aligns more closely with the downstream clean image distribution. 
This makes the adaptation during fine-tuning remarkably easy. 
Even with just one epoch of fine-tuning on downstream clean images, the model can achieve excellent accuracy and robustness.


Under the situation of mixed noise, the normalization layer of the model plays a decisive role in the success of  transfer, but it is often overlooked.
Current work on randomized smoothing heavily uses ResNet, where the Batch Norm by default computes the training set's running mean and variance, which are then applied to the validation set and the downstream dataset.
We conducted extensive ablation studies with various normalization layers, discovering that these statistics severely hamper robust transfer capabilities when noise is mixed.
Our analysis indicates that the mixing of multiple noises increases the disparity in the noisy data distribution.
Therefore, it's crucial not to use these statistics when mixing noise.


We conducted mixed noise pretraining on ImageNet and then fine-tuned on clean images across twelve downstream datasets. With minimal fine-tuning cost, we obtained impressive results on all these datasets.

\subsection{Language}

All manuscripts must be in English.

\subsection{Dual submission}

Please refer to the author guidelines on the \confName\ \confYear\ web page for a
discussion of the policy on dual submissions.

\subsection{Paper length}
Papers, excluding the references section, must be no longer than eight pages in length.
The references section will not be included in the page count, and there is no limit on the length of the references section.
For example, a paper of eight pages with two pages of references would have a total length of 10 pages.
{\bf There will be no extra page charges for \confName\ \confYear.}

Overlength papers will simply not be reviewed.
This includes papers where the margins and formatting are deemed to have been significantly altered from those laid down by this style guide.
Note that this \LaTeX\ guide already sets figure captions and references in a smaller font.
The reason such papers will not be reviewed is that there is no provision for supervised revisions of manuscripts.
The reviewing process cannot determine the suitability of the paper for presentation in eight pages if it is reviewed in eleven.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection{The ruler}
The \LaTeX\ style defines a printed ruler which should be present in the version submitted for review.
The ruler is provided in order that reviewers may comment on particular lines in the paper without circumlocution.
If you are preparing a document using a non-\LaTeX\ document preparation system, please arrange for an equivalent ruler to appear on the final output pages.
The presence or absence of the ruler should not change the appearance of any other content on the page.
The camera-ready copy should not contain a ruler.
(\LaTeX\ users may use options of \texttt{cvpr.sty} to switch between different versions.)

Reviewers:
note that the ruler measurements do not align well with lines in the paper --- this turns out to be very difficult to do well when the paper contains many figures and equations, and, when done, looks ugly.
Just use fractional references (\eg, this line is $087.5$), although in most cases one would expect that the approximate location will be adequate.


\subsection{Paper ID}
Make sure that the Paper ID from the submission system is visible in the version submitted for review (replacing the ``*****'' you see in this document).
If you are using the \LaTeX\ template, \textbf{make sure to update paper ID in the appropriate place in the tex file}.


\subsection{Mathematics}

Please number all of your sections and displayed equations as in these examples:
\begin{equation}
  E = m\cdot c^2
  \label{eq:important}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  v = a\cdot t.
  \label{eq:also-important}
\end{equation}
It is important for readers to be able to refer to any particular equation.
Just because you did not refer to it in the text does not mean some future reader might not need to refer to it.
It is cumbersome to have to use circumlocutions like ``the equation second from the top of page 3 column 1''.
(Note that the ruler will not be present in the final copy, so is not an alternative to equation numbers).
All authors will benefit from reading Mermin's description of how to write mathematics:
\url{http://www.pamitc.org/documents/mermin.pdf}.

\subsection{Blind review}

Many authors misunderstand the concept of anonymizing for blind review.
Blind review does not mean that one must remove citations to one's own work---in fact it is often impossible to review a paper unless the previous citations are known and available.

Blind review means that you do not use the words ``my'' or ``our'' when citing previous work.
That is all.
(But see below for tech reports.)

Saying ``this builds on the work of Lucy Smith [1]'' does not say that you are Lucy Smith;
it says that you are building on her work.
If you are Smith and Jones, do not say ``as we show in [7]'', say ``as Smith and Jones show in [7]'' and at the end of the paper, include reference 7 as you would any other cited work.

An example of a bad paper just asking to be rejected:
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
    An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
\end{center}

   In this paper we present a performance analysis of our previous paper [1], and show it to be inferior to all previously known methods.
   Why the previous paper was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

   [1] Removed for blind review
\end{quote}


An example of an acceptable paper:
\begin{quote}
\begin{center}
     An analysis of the frobnicatable foo filter.
\end{center}

   In this paper we present a performance analysis of the  paper of Smith \etal [1], and show it to be inferior to all previously known methods.
   Why the previous paper was accepted without this analysis is beyond me.

   [1] Smith, L and Jones, C. ``The frobnicatable foo filter, a fundamental contribution to human knowledge''. Nature 381(12), 1-213.
\end{quote}

If you are making a submission to another conference at the same time, which covers similar or overlapping material, you may need to refer to that submission in order to explain the differences, just as you would if you had previously published related work.
In such cases, include the anonymized parallel submission~\cite{Authors14} as supplemental material and cite it as
\begin{quote}
[1] Authors. ``The frobnicatable foo filter'', F\&G 2014 Submission ID 324, Supplied as supplemental material {\tt fg324.pdf}.
\end{quote}

Finally, you may feel you need to tell the reader that more details can be found elsewhere, and refer them to a technical report.
For conference submissions, the paper must stand on its own, and not {\em require} the reviewer to go to a tech report for further details.
Thus, you may say in the body of the paper ``further details may be found in~\cite{Authors14b}''.
Then submit the tech report as supplemental material.
Again, you may not assume the reviewers will read this material.

Sometimes your paper is about a problem which you tested using a tool that is widely known to be restricted to a single institution.
For example, let's say it's 1969, you have solved a key problem on the Apollo lander, and you believe that the 1970 audience would like to hear about your
solution.
The work is a development of your celebrated 1968 paper entitled ``Zero-g frobnication: How being the only people in the world with access to the Apollo lander source code makes us a wow at parties'', by Zeus \etal.

You can handle this paper like any other.
Do not write ``We show how to improve our previous work [Anonymous, 1968].
This time we tested the algorithm on a lunar lander [name of lander removed for blind review]''.
That would be silly, and would immediately identify the authors.
Instead write the following:
\begin{quotation}
\noindent
   We describe a system for zero-g frobnication.
   This system is new because it handles the following cases:
   A, B.  Previous systems [Zeus et al. 1968] did not  handle case B properly.
   Ours handles it by including a foo term in the bar integral.

   ...

   The proposed system was integrated with the Apollo lunar lander, and went all the way to the moon, don't you know.
   It displayed the following behaviours, which show how well we solved cases A and B: ...
\end{quotation}
As you can see, the above text follows standard scientific convention, reads better than the first version, and does not explicitly name you as the authors.
A reviewer might think it likely that the new paper was written by Zeus \etal, but cannot make any decision based on that guess.
He or she would have to be sure that no other authors could have been contracted to solve problem B.

FAQ\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} Are acknowledgements OK?\\
{\bf A:} No.  Leave them for the final copy.\medskip\\
{\bf Q:} How do I cite my results reported in open challenges?
{\bf A:} To conform with the double-blind review policy, you can report results of other challenge participants together with your results in your paper.
For your results, however, you should not identify yourself and should not mention your participation in the challenge.
Instead present your results referring to the method proposed in your paper and draw conclusions based on the experimental comparison to other results.\medskip\\

\subsection{Miscellaneous}

\noindent
Compare the following:\\
\begin{tabular}{ll}
 \verb'$conf_a$' &  $conf_a$ \\
 \verb'$\mathit{conf}_a$' & $\mathit{conf}_a$
\end{tabular}\\
See The \TeX book, p165.

The space after \eg, meaning ``for example'', should not be a sentence-ending space.
So \eg is correct, {\em e.g.} is not.
The provided \verb'\eg' macro takes care of this.

When citing a multi-author paper, you may save space by using ``et alia'', shortened to ``\etal'' (not ``{\em et.\ al.}'' as ``{\em et}'' is a complete word).
If you use the \verb'\etal' macro provided, then you need not worry about double periods when used at the end of a sentence as in Alpher \etal.
However, use it only when there are three or more authors.
Thus, the following is correct:
   ``Frobnication has been trendy lately.
   It was introduced by Alpher~\cite{Alpher02}, and subsequently developed by
   Alpher and Fotheringham-Smythe~\cite{Alpher03}, and Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher04}.''

This is incorrect: ``... subsequently developed by Alpher \etal~\cite{Alpher03} ...'' because reference~\cite{Alpher03} has just two authors.
